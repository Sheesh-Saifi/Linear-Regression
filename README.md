# Linear-Regression
An implementation of Linear Regression to understand it's working on datasets with Matlab/Octave.



## What is this Program about?

A supervised machine learning code which wil apply linear Regression on dataset "ex1data1.txt".

The purpose is to plot graphs, contour plots and understand the working of Linear Regression Algorigth.
